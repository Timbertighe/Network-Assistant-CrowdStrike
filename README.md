# CrowdStrike plugin
Handles webhooks from the CrowdStrike platform

# Using the plugin
## Webhooks
### Enabling Webhooks
    This requires webhook alerts to be configured on CrowdStrike
    Configure the webhook plugin with a destination and secret
      Optionally the authentication header can be changed
    Then configure a notification workflow to use the defined webhook
    https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/notification-workflows/
    
### Webhook Authentication
    CrowdStrike webook authentication uses the 'X-Cs-Primary-Signature' header
    This contains a secret that is defined by CrowdStrike when they send the webhook
    The signature is generated by concatenating the message body with the 'X-Cs-Delivery-Timestamp' header, and generating an HMAC-SHA256 secret
      The body needs to be decoded to utf-8
          

## Configuration
### Overview
    Plugin configuration is in the 'config.yaml' file
    
#### Plugin Config
    Set 'webhook_secret' to the secret, as set in the CrowdStrike webhook configuration
    Set the 'auth_header' to X-Cs-Primary-Signature, or the custom header you configured on the CS platform
